Creatures
    Ice Elemental
    Frost Wyrm
        Small, very fast
        Latches onto player
        Slowly drains health, hunger, or warmth
    Goat
    Mammoth

Mechanics
    Cold
        Works similarly to hunger
        Certain types of armor slow drain
        Water in Glacios rapidly speeds up
        Fire blocks increase, torches maintain
        Multiple configurable difficulties
        Easy: No cold meter.
        Normal: It's like a second hunger bar.
        Hard: Faster and more punishing, but nothing especially vicious or unique.
        Hardcore: THIS IS THE REAL GLACIOS! When you're cold, you move slower, you get hungry faster, 
        and you take more damage. Don't freeze. :)
