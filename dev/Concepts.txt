Creatures
    Ice Elemental
    Frost Wyrm
        Small, very fast
        Latches onto player
        Slowly drains health, hunger, or warmth
    Goat
    Mammoth

Mechanics
    Cold
        Works similarly to hunger
        Certain types of armor slow drain
        Water in Glacios rapidly speeds up
        Fire blocks increase, torches maintain
    Longer Nights

Environment
    Huge cave systems (similar to Nether)
    (Possibly) heigher height limit
        Would be for compensating for larger cave systems
