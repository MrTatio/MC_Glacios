    Biomes O' Plenty

Creatures
    Ice Elemental
    Arctic Wyrm
        Small, very fast
        Latches onto player
        Slowly drains health, hunger, or warmth
    Goat
    Mammoth
    Will o' Whisp
    Grick
    Illithid
    Drake

Mechanics
    Cold
        Works similarly to hunger
        Certain types of armor slow drain
        Water in Glacios rapidly speeds up
        Fire blocks increase, torches maintain
        Multiple configurable difficulties
            Easy: No cold meter.
            Normal: It's like a second hunger bar.
            Hard: Faster and more punishing, but nothing especially vicious or unique.
            Hardcore: THIS IS THE REAL GLACIOS! When you're cold, you move slower, you get hungry faster, 
                and you take more damage. Don't freeze. :)
    Longer Nights

Environment
    Huge cave systems (similar to Nether)
    (Possibly) higher height limit
        Would be for compensating for larger cave systems
    Ice Lens
        Pockets of frozen water underground.
    BIOMES (Bases):
        Extreme Hills
        Floating Island
        Lake
        Ocean
        Plains
        Plateau
        Taiga
        Underworld
        Volcano
        
Item
    Ores
        Oridecon
            Deep blue crystalline metal that fractures into sharp edges.
            Because of its structural nature, it tends to shatter into slivers upon forceful contact.
            This makes for high damaging weapons and armor that lashes back at the attacker, but also makes it less durable.
        Darksteel
            Highly dense metallic ore that is nearly impossible to destroy.
            Because of its density, it isn't easy to forge into proper shapes.
            This makes for lower quality weapons and armor, though the equipment will last an absurdly long time.
        Uru
            Made from the core of a dying star, uru contains magical properties unlike any other.
            While the material is typically only smeltable at extreme temperatures, priming with prism shards
                makes the material possible to work with.  While this degrades the quality, it still proves a viable solution.
            Uru as a smelting ore doens't make very good weapons.  However, the magical properties enhance enchantments
                placed upon it and allow it to physically change itself when enchanted, making it more durable.
    Prism Shard
        Item dropped from the Prism Shard block.  Can be used to make lanterns, or in the priming of raw uru ore.

        Prism Shard

            Possible colors are blue, red, green, and purple.
        Gelisol
            A classification of soil that contain permafrost, a layer of soil near the surface that is frozen year-round.
